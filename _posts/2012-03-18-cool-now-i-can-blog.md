Really I can!

Checked out the other three 144MHz band III 400W PA conversions today, all going well. Just one scary moment when a tantalum electrolytic exploded, but no major Damage, just a bit smelly.

Had a look at the combiner as well and worked out how to split it and move it down to 144MHz, but I need some quarter inch 75 0hm PTFE cable (RG302) to do the output combiner; I donâ€™t think my RG179 will take 800Watts! Can anyone help?
