As of about 2200UTC, we’re now all home safely – including G3VFC who had the extra 100 mile drive back to Kent. It was a fantastic trip – lots of contacts, lots built, lots learnt, lots of fun had by all. And quite a bit of custard consumed.

We spent a few moments on the journey back wondering how many QSL cards would be sitting on my doorstep when I got home, and having just about managed to force the front door open over the piles of envelopes, the answer turned out to be a rather amazing 91:

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1132" style="width: 570px">[![QSL Cards on return](http://dx.camb-hams.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/IMG_8150.jpg "IMG_8150")](http://dx.camb-hams.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/IMG_8150.jpg)QSL Cards on return

</div>Thanks so much to all those who took the time to work us, the patience to crack some of the pileups, to those listening and supporting us back home, those who lent us kit, those who sponsored us, helped us with the 6m high power NoV, and to all those who thanked us for putting the station on air – it’d be worth nothing if you didn’t speak to us when we did so! Thanks, guys, all of you.

We’ll be sorting out our own QSL card in the coming weeks – we need to sort through our favourite photos from the trip first and get it designed, so please bear with us if you don’t get a card back immediately, but we will be on the case. I’ll post updates here as things progress.

73,

Rob, M0VFC, and all the Harris team
