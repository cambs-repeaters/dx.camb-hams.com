So something we planned to do was activate the May [RSGB UKAC](http://www.rsgbcc.org/cgi-bin/contest_rules.pl?year=2011&contest=2mukac&seq=) from Arran. The cottage we are renting is on the west of the island and not so good for VHF to the UK. We knew that we would need to head out in [Flossie](http://www.camb-hams.com/flossie) and find a better location. Earlier in the day a few of the team headed out for a drive and found a great location on the south east of the island with clear take-off from the north east to south west.

In the end we managed 49 QSOs with 16 mults â€“ total claimed points was 203,808.
