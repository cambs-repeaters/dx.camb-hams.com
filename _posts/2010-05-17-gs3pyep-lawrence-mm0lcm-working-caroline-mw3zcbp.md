Thanks to Martyn M1MAJ for the video – he goes on to say:

The summit, Y Llethr, was a fine one for playing radio: a wall for shelter, a nice flat grassy area for antennas, and wonderful views.[![view from Y Llethr by M1MAJ](http://dx.camb-hams.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Y-Llethr-300x225.jpg "Y Llethr")](http://dx.camb-hams.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Y-Llethr.jpg) I’ve attached a more distant view of the station as there’s not really a lot to see of it in the video.

One thing we really noticed on our summit contacts was that the audio quality of GS3PYE was superb.
