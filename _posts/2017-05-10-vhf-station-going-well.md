The VHF station has been running well since the day we arrived. It was setup and making QSO’s by 19:00z on Saturday.

## The VHF Antennas

As usual, the Camb-Hams trailer mast has been used for the VHF antennas. The G1000 rotator is in a cage this year to help reduce the strain on it, especially when lidting to the vertical position.

From bottom to top the antennas are;

- 6m: 6ele YU7EF EF0606
- 2m: 17ele Tonna + DG8 preamp
- 4m: 7ele YU7EF EF0707

4m and 2m are fed by LBC-400 coax, and 6m is using H2020 coax.

## The VHF Operating Position

The VHF desk runs all 3 VHF bands, at the same time usually. The setup here is;

- 6m: Elecraft K3 + Quadra PA
- 4m: Icom IC756pro3 + [Anglian Xverter + MRF-151G PA](http://www.geekshed.co.uk/4m-transverter/)
- 2m: Icom IC-910H + M1BXF [homebrew SSPA](http://www.geekshed.co.uk/144mhz-1-25kw-sspa-amplifier/)

To work 3 stations there is a need for 2 laptops + a 21” monitor, The monitor allows 2 MSHV windows (2m + 6m) to be shown side-by side, with the main laptop display to be used for KST chat and other computer activities. The 3rd MSHV (4M) window is running on the netbook (above the Pro3).

At the time of writing this, on VHF we have made 96 QSOs; 42 on 6m, 14 on 4m and 40 on 2m, including 16 on 2m EME.
