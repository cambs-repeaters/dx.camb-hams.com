The attached photo shows the 4x23ele yagis and the Spid rotor set up on my dish mount at home. The small white box with the heatsink is the transverter. (the big grey box is my 13cm EME transverter)

I’m currently doing some RX tests using the sun noise to cold sky noise ratio which is a disappointing 4 dB at the moment but I’ve just thrown it together so far, so I’ll try and optimise everything on RX, do some “sums” and see how close to theoretical my RX performance is.

EME is all about decimals of dBs!

I plan to listen “off the moon” tonight and see if I can receive anything when the moon comes up later today and if any of the big stations are on.
