If you are in the UK you can watch [Monty Hallsâ€™ Great Hebridean Escape](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00s75z7) (episode 4) where he visits the Monach Islands again showing were we operated from as GM3PYE/P overnight between May 5th and 6th. While he is there he helps the crofter Donald MacDonald who grazes his sheep on the island. Donald and his son, who is not featured, were staying in the School House with us when we activated EU-111 and his son was telling us with pride that his dad would be on TV! You can see [Monty on the Monachs from the appropriate point on BBC iPlayer](http://bbc.co.uk/i/sf1sd/?t=47m05s) (only available in the UK).

Here is a picture Gavin M1BXF took of the seals lazing on the beach while on the Monachs, all the black are seals!
