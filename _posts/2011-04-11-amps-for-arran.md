A few Camb-Hams headed up to the [Norbreck Amateur Radio, Electronics and Computing Exhibition](http://www.narsa.org.uk/) in Blackpool over the weekend where DXâ€™Pedition member Mark M0MJH had arranged collection of the Discovery 64 and Challenger amplifiers from Paul Cullen (G4KTZ) of [Linear Amps UK](http://linamp.co.uk/), one of our sponsors for 2011 who also sponsored us in 2010.

Martyn M1MAJ and Caroline M3ZCB were on hand to get a few snaps of the amplifiers and Paul handing them over to Mark (but probably insisting Mark carried them to his car!).
