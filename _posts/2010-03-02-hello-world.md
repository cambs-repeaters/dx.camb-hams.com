The next planning session for the Harris 2010 DXpedition is on Wednesday 10th March, at the Blue Lion, Hardwick. Most folk arrive around 19:00 for dinner.

Rough agenda â€“ we would like to discuss and possibly agree:

- Final attendees + contact details
- Costs
- Equipment List
- Transport
- Food/drink
- Operating schedule (bands, modes etc).
