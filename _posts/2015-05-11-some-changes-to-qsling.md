[![Outgoing QSLs](http://dx.camb-hams.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-05-12-00.00.31-300x225.jpg)](http://dx.camb-hams.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-05-12-00.00.31.jpg)This year, we’re making some changes to the way we handle QSL cards.

If you requested a direct card in 2014, you may have found it took longer than normal to get a reply – entirely my (M0VFC’s) fault, after a year of trying to do too much in not enough time! Hopefully you will have received your card by now, but if not, let me know by email (see QRZ.com) and I will check the log to make sure your card has been sent. My apologies for keeping some of you waiting for so long, and thank you for your patience.

To avoid these delays happening again this year, we would like **all QSL requests to use OQRS** (online QSL request system). As before, this will be using Club Log, and logs will be uploaded regularly. This applies to both direct (£1.50 – about $2.40) and bureau (free) requests.

Here’s why we believe OQRS is a better option:

- It’s cheaper for you: you don’t have to use one of your own cards, or envelopes, or postage to us – only the return postage.
- It’s faster for you: your card doesn’t have to get to us before we can reply. This is particularly important for bureau requests!
- It’s faster for us: instead of opening each envelope, typing in and checking QSO details, we can print all the labels instantly. This means we can get your card back to you faster.
- It’s cheaper for everyone using the bureau: because you don’t need to send us your card, it halves the amount of cards that the bureau needs to sort.

We realise in a few countries, PayPal is not available, so if you really cannot use OQRS, cards sent direct to M0VFC will still receive a reply, but OQRS requests will be processed first.

Finally, please QSL responsibly:

- If you have requested a card using OQRS, do not send us your paper card as well – we do not collect them!
- Consider whether you really need every QSO confirmed, or whether only some would be enough.

We are, of course, very happy to send QSL cards to those who want them, or need them for an award, but also wish to reduce the amount of waste currently in the system.
