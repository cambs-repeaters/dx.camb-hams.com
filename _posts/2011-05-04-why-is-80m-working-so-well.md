I spent another fantastic evening on 80m from GS3PYE/P last night and was asked many times why we were putting out such a good signal. I thought I’d go out today and take some pictures which might help to explain it.

The antenna is a vertical, based on a Spiderbeam 18m pole, with lots of radials. It’s ‘planted’ in the lower lawn, just next to the stream which runs through the garden.

</div>The antenna is great, but the view that the antenna has is fantastic. I took a walk up the hill behind the house this afternoon and took a panorama shot to show the whole 180 deg of water that we see from here to the west. I think this was a major factor when I worked so many US and Canadian stations on 80m on Monday night (using the [Kenwood](http://bit.ly/cambhams-kenwood) TS590S).

</div>Last night I was using the [Icom](http://bit.ly/cambhams-icom) IC-9100 on 80m and had a huge pile-up. I called CQ once at the start, and then again after 3 hours – all the time in between was full of stations calling – great fun. I’m looking forward to having another go on 80m again tonight.
