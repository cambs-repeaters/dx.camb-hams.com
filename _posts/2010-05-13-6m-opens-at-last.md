At about 12:00z today 6m eventually opened for us after nearly 2 weeks of waiting! We have added about 120 6m SSB contacts to the log in the past 2 hours ðŸ™‚

Thanks to ON4KST for the great maps based on the DX Cluster and you can see the GS3PYE/P spots from the Isle of Harris in IO67 and GM4KGK from IO68 in Lewis.
