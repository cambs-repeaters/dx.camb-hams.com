The guys from Macclesfield &amp; District Amateur Radio Society activated the Isle of Arran, IOTA EU-123 in April 2011. Since the Camb-Hams were also planning a trip there a month later, we thought we’d try and work them from our monthly "Pye &amp; Pint" meet-up at one of the local pubs.   
They were a cracking signal, despite our relatively compromised antenna – thanks guys!
