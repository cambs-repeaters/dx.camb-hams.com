I have now completed the [G3XBM Transverter](https://sites.google.com/site/g3xbmqrp3/mflf/472khz_tvtr). (see picture)

It produces around 10-15 Watts on 472kHz driven from and FT817 on 80m. The 817 has been checked out on WSPR receive, so I need to find out what other digimodes I need to prepare. The switching PA design means that we are limited to modes that donâ€™t need a linear transverter so I understand that JT9 is getting popular as a QSO mode as well as CW. I need to start thinking about an antenna and an ATU.
