As well as terrestrial operation, we plan to run a JT65B digital EME station using a single 17 element yagi and full legal limit on 144MHz. Sked co ordination will be via [http://www.chris.org/cgi-bin/jt65emeA](http://www.chris.org/cgi-bin/jt65emeA "http://www.chris.org/cgi-bin/jt65emeA")

I’ve run the dates of the trip through Moonsked and attached is a rough (hourly) table of when the moon is below 20 degrees at our site on Mull during the DXpedition.

This will give us the best “ground gain” so the best time to try and work us. If the plan to put elevation on the Yagi is successful we may be active outside these windows but may not be quite as strong.
