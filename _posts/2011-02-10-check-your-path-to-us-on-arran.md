Using the brilliant heywhatsthat site we have [setup a profile so you can check the path](http://www.heywhatsthat.com/?view=OE3J4NJF) profile between where you are and where we will be on the West side of the Island of Arran. Zoom out and click on your location on the map and check which hills are in the way above.
