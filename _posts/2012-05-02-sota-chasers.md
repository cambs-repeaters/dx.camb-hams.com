I’m loving SOTA chasers today. Just come back from an activation of Ben More, GM/SI-003 with my 40m CW rig. The first time I took it out I was worried that no-one would come back to me, and that my CW wouldn’t be good enough to actually work anyone.

Three times this week I’ve called CQ on 7.030+/-, and every time someone has come back to me and patiently accepted my ropey morse code.

While I love walking up mountains, you guys who keep the radio on in the shack and work SOTA activators deserve a shout.

Thank you.
