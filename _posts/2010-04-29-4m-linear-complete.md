So not only do we have a Discovery 64 amplifier kindly loaned to us for the duration of the DXâ€™Pedition by [Linear Amp Ltd](http://bit.ly/camb-hams-linamps) but we also have a 300 watt capable 4 meter amp based on an MRF-151G part, meaning that working 6m / 4m crossband just got a whole lot easier! She may not be pretty but for 2 watts in we get 300 watts out ðŸ™‚
