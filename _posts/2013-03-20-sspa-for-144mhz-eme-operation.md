I have now completed the assembly and initial bench test of the 2 x Harris 144MHz SSPA, and it’s looking good. Just needs a little interfacing work by Gav plus a couple of fan guards and a good testing before it gets the go ahead to be included in the trip. Here’s a couple of pictures of the assembled Amplifier.

Does full legal limit for 12 Watts in on 144MHz.

Nice……
