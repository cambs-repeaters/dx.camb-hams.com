This afternoon we made our first satellite QSOs, 2M0SQL (operating the radio), MM0VFC (Antenna Rotator), MM0LCM (Camera Man) went up the hill by the cottage with a clear take off all around. Using a FT-817 and Arrow antenna we were able to work two stations EA1JM and OM3WAN via AO-27 and hope to be on a few other passes during today and tomorrow.
