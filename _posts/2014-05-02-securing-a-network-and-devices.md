Securing a network requires a complex combination of hardware devices, such as routers, firewalls and anti-malware software applications. It also requires designing the installation and configuration process for those devices. By deploying a special malware-suppressing feature, we’re delivering the ability for network admins to control and secure their networks without the need for special software, workstation hardware or complex network configurations.

**A Network Defense &amp; Security solution**

In the past year, we have been working with companies, businesses and public and private sector organizations in two areas to address the growing number of attacks coming from adversaries who are using malicious code with the explicit aim of doing business harm. These two areas are:

The private sector building security into a private business network can create an immunity from attacks, and the less common threat of ransomware.

Building security with the help of [threat detection software](https://inquest.net/defend-the-enterprise/network-detection-and-response) into a private business network can create an immunity from attacks, and the less common threat of ransomware. Government organizations Governments are among the most widely-employed, most trusted and most complex businesses in the world. In addition, the evolution of cyber security isn’t restricted to the private sector since they know about [Active Fire Protection vs. Passive Fire Protection: What is the Difference?](https://firebarrierexperts.com/active-fire-protection-vs-passive-fire-protection-what-is-the-difference/). There are numerous open government networks networks operated by the government that you need to secure and these networks can pose significant threats to critical infrastructure.

In the wake of the recent reports of ransomware attacks, we have spent the past year deploying new systems for our services and our suppliers to allow them to take full advantage of these new threats. It has been exciting to see how our customers have handled [ransomware](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/ransomware) mostly by the use of professional security services to avoid this. For instance, people using service providers through their Internet of Things devices have realized the value of having a network defense component to make sure their service is secure.
