Colin Leonard G4ERO (GM4ERO while in Scotland) – Another highly valued member of the team, Colin built the 4m and 6m beam antennas, as well as the legs for M0LCM’s SCAM mast. Very handy in a workshop, and a skilled operator on voice or CW. Also brought along his Elecraft K3, which he’s using here. Working OM8CM on 17m CW when this picture was taken.
