About this time last year, we were thinking 4000 QSOs might be a good target to aim for – and after packing down most of the station on the Friday afternoon, we eventually managed to [struggle through to number 4000](http://dx.camb-hams.com/2009/04/24/shack-qso-total-reaches-4000/) at 2315 in the evening. This year we were here for two weeks, so 8000 seemed a natural target… a challenge, no doubt, as we expected to work most of those who were keen to get the island in their logs earlier rather than later, but we thought with a little more effort we could probably manage it.

Helped by the nearly 1700 contacts from the Monach islands, we managed the 8000 this morning with nearly a full day to spare, Colin G4ERO making the 8000th QSO shortly after passing his own 1000 mark – congratulations on both counts, Colin!
