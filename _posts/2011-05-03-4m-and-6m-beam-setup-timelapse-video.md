While setting up the shack on arrival quite a few of the members got involved in setting up the 6m and 4m beam antennas on the groupâ€™s trailer mast. The antennas are both YU7EF designs with the top antenna being a [6 element EF0606](http://www.yu7ef.com/ef0606.htm) for 6m and the lower antenna a [7 element EF0407](http://www.yu7ef.com/ef0407.htm) for 4m.
