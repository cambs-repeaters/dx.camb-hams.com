This year we have again put all the VHF and up stations together in [Flossie](http://www.camb-hams.com/flossie), These are;

- 6m = JT6m, ISCAT-B &amp; SSB
- 4m = FSK &amp; SSB
- 2m = MS and JT65 (EME)
- 23cm = JT65 (EME)

[![Flossie_VHF](http://dx.camb-hams.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Flossie_VHF_thumb.jpg "Flossie_VHF")](http://dx.camb-hams.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Flossie_VHF.jpg)

This makes sense as we find the same stations usually want to work us back to back on all the different bands and with 2 operators we can run 2 bands each (6m + 4m) &amp; (2m + 23cm).
