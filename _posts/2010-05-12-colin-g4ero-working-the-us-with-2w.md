Colin G4ERO dusted off his key for this DX’Pedition and got his Elecraft KX1 out to get himself back into CW, got to love the Camb-hams! He’s current working US stations on 40m using 2 watts into an inverted V antenna! Please work him if you hear him and bear in mind his CW is still a bit rusty but getting better: )
