This morning a group of thirteen operators will be heading off to the Isle of Lewis via Fort William during our travels you will be able to track us on APRS but also we’ll be operating HF mobile while on route (Recommend watching the DX Cluster and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23lewis2014&src=typd&f=realtime)).

We should arrive on the Island on Saturday the 26<sup>th</sup> and be on air soon after, we will be covering the HF bands with five simultaneous stations, while the 6m &amp; 4m stations will have a great take-off towards the UK and Europe from the island’s northern tip in IO68 square. All stations will be able to run at the full UK power limit.

EME operations will use 150W to 55 elements on 23cm and 400W to 17 elements on 2m. Primarily on JT65 but also available for CW skeds – if your station is big enough.

Satellite operations on 2m &amp; 70cm will use X-Quad antennas and a fully automatic Az/El tracking system.

Contest operations will take place in the RSGB 70MHz UKAC on 29 April.

A number of the group hope to make an extra trip to operate as GS6PYE/P from the Shiant Isles (EU-112). They are aiming for afternoon/early evening operations on 28 April, but may switch to 30 April if the weather is bad.

We will be doing our best to share as much information as possible about the operation on the blog, but also [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/g3pye) ([\#Lewis2014](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23lewis2014&src=typd&f=realtime)), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CambHams) and [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/CambHams%20).
