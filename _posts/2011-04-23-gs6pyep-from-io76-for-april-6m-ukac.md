So DXâ€™Pedition members Colin G8TMV and Gavin M1BXF will be heading north a week before the rest for an extended holiday. They will be staying in Dumbarton and on Tuesday will be active from IO76 square to give some points away. Equipment will be an IC-7000, the groups 30ft mast and a 5 element Tonna.
