After Gavin, M1BXF added a couple more entries this evening, we uploaded our latest logs to G7VJR’s ClubLog, and reached that magic number:

That’s just from this year’s trip (including the GM3PYE/P operation on the Monachs), which isn’t bad going. For those interested, the two DXCCs we’re missing on Phone are the Isle of Man (only 6m JT6m) and Cuba (40m PSK31).

Recent additions include (most recent first):

- Sint Maarten
- Jordan
- St. Kitts &amp; Nevis
- Guyana
- Dominican Republic
- Panama
- Cuba
- St. Vincent
- Jamaica

And so to bed…
