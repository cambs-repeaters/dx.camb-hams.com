We are rapidly approaching leaving for the Isle of Lewis and my inbox has regularly been getting requests for satellite QSO skeds especially with stations in North America – I’ve just run the predictions for the week we’re on the island in SatPC32 which has generated a nice list of possible passes which can be found at [https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B\_1dHk8Yo754eHlkTlhBQmRsam8/edit](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_1dHk8Yo754eHlkTlhBQmRsam8/edit)

I’d recommend if you’d like to try a sked that you try request satellite passes from Sunday the 27<sup>th</sup> onwards, clearly its dependant on someone being available but we’ll do our best to make sure someone’s available.

You can request satellite skeds by either emailing us at [skeds-2014@camb-hams.com](<mailto:skeds-2014@camb-hams.com?subject=I would like a satellite sked>) or sending [@2e0sql](https://twitter.com/2e0sql/) a tweet. We will do our best to tweet which passes we will be on.
