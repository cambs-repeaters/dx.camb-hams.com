One thing which was noticed in the Mull2013 DX’Pedition was how annoying a south stop rotator was on 6m. Moving between SP and CT was via north and \*very\* slow.

We use Gavin M1BXF HAM IV rotator and this year he’s done [some updates](http://www.geekshed.co.uk/hy-gain-ham-iv-rotator-upgrade/) to it.
