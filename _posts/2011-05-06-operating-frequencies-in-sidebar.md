Some of you may have noticed an update to the site yesterday where we added a widget to the top right sidebar showing the last frequency each station was seen on â€“ this should make it easier for you to find and work us.

This widget only shows stations which have logged a QSO in the past 25 minutes, anything older is removed (on the assumption that the station has closed down).
