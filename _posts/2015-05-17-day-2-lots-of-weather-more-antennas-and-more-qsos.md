At times the rain static on the VHF antennas causes a lot of noise, and similarly on HF

We’ve put up some more antennas, including 10m and 15m rotary dipoles and an inverted-V for 80m, so we’re now operational on all our planned bands except 12m, where we plan a vertical dipole.

The QSO total currently stands at around 2,700, and all QSOs up to 1327 UTC today (Sunday) are now uploaded to both Club Log and LoTW. We’ll continue uploading periodically as internet access allows.
