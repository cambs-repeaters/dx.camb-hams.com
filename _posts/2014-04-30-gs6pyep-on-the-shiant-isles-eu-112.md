Photographs from our GS6PYE/P activation of the Shiant Isles (EU-112) on 28 April 2014.  
The operators were Dom M0BLF, Rob M0VFC and Steve M1ACB.

The radios were a pair of Icom IC-706MkIIG’s.  
The antennas were a quarter wave vertical for 20m and a vertical dipole for 15m.

We made 1136 contacts on the 20m and 15m bands.

Photos of the activation are available here : <https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=ShiantsDX2014>
