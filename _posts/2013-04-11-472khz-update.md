Successful tests today of the 472kHz TX converter with WSPR, Reports from over 600km this evening. I’m still a little unsure of how good the receiver on the 817 is so more tests on that tomorrow.

Hope to play with antennas up at Wort’s causeway over the weekend, WX permitting? I will bring Rob’s VNA, the transverter, the ground stakes and the matching coil if someone can bring the spiderbeam pole and the wire… and of course Flossie for power and coffee making facilities!
