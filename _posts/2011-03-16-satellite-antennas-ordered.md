After hunting high and low for some satellite antenna designs to make and nothing being found it was decided to go and purchase some. After again looking high and low for decent satellite antennas at a reasonable cost vs suitability we had to goto foreign shores, in this instance WiMo.


In the end we ordered both 2m and 70cm antennas (2m 2×7-Ele 10dBD, WX 7020 70cm 2×10-Ele 11,5dBD) and phasing harnesses for each. With postage it was a little over £320.

At the Vernon Dutch rally at the weekend a suitable potentiometer was also purchased for the dirty one currently in the satellite rotator so satellites should be much more successful this year.
