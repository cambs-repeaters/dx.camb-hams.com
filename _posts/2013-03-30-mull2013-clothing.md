Every year we go out and get branded clothing for the dx’pedition. This year we changed supplier to [RebelScum Workshop](http://www.rebelscumworkshop.co.uk/) after one of our group recommended them to us and the decision was a very good one it turned out. Not only was the price cheaper than the competition but the quality was fantastic and the detail much more.

The detail is the colour shading in out logo which was missing from our previous supplier, but [RebelScum Workshop](http://www.rebelscumworkshop.co.uk/) was able to provide. See the semi-circles around our groups name in the first images is solid yet in the RebelScum Workshop version below has shading.

Something we also done new this year, which our previous supplier couldn’t manage was vinyl printing on the back of the clothing which allowed additional callsigns or logos, here is another example of what RebelScum Workshop could do, for an additional £1.50!
