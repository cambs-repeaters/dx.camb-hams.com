All of the team are now home and most are back at work. Some of the Cambridge lads drove all the way back on Saturday and some had a stop-off on the way and came back on Sunday. Our QSL manager Neil G4HUN returned to a pile of QSL cards which had slowly accumulated over the week – we expect a big influx on cards now the dx’pedition is over, please be patient for a return card as we need to decide on the final design and then get them made up.

We all had a ball and are already thinking about ways to beat this years activities next year.
