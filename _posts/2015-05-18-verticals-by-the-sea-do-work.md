[![Verticals by the sea](http://dx.camb-hams.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-05-18-17.32.57-300x225.jpg)](http://dx.camb-hams.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-05-18-17.32.57.jpg)We’ve now been on air for about three days, and the QSO count stands at a satisfying 5,500. Everything up to 2015-05-18 1629 UTC has been uploaded to Club Log and LoTW, and we’ll continue with regular uploads throughout the week.

We now have the full compliment of HF bands available to us thanks to a 12m vertical dipole, and the satellite antennas are up, so we have the first QSOs in the log from some of those passes.

The highest HF bands (10 and 12m) have been relatively quiet so far here, so we’ve been concentrating on CW on them until propagation supports SSB. If you’re looking for us on those bands, it’s worth checking the [Reverse Beacon Network](http://skimmer.g7vjr.org?dx=GS3PYE) for CW.

We’ve had some positive comments about our signals, and here having vertical antennas right next to the sea certainly helps -as you can see from the photo, the radials from the 40m 1/4 wave vertical (closest to the camera) are actually under water at high tide. Moving back, there’s 17m and 20m, with 12m in the distance.
