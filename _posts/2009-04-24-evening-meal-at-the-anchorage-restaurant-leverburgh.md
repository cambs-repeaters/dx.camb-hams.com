Thursday evening was Jim the chef’s night off so we had booked in at a local restaurant in [Leverburgh](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=leverburgh&sll=53.800651,-4.064941&sspn=20.068519,44.648438&ie=UTF8&ll=57.770123,-7.009277&spn=0.281974,0.697632&z=11&iwloc=A).

We all left the cottage around 18:45 for the 15 mile trip we managed to get all 12 people in 3 cars and set off, strange now I think of it but I am sure I remember that I could hear the song “convoy” playing in the background……

The [restaurant](http://www.leverburgh.co.uk/anchorage.htm) is located on the sea front right next to the ferry port that takes you over the the island of Benbecula and it has nice sea views of the local coast.
