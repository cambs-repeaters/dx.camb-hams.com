So I’ve done some basic log analysis for the Arran DX’Pedition, more will follow but for now I’m looking mainly at the QSO rates vs time. You can see the full analysis [here in PDF form](http://dx.camb-hams.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/GS3PYE_Arran_DXPedition_2011_Log_Analysis_Part1.pdf).

To keep things easier to display \[in the graphs\] the report is based on 30 minute snapshots i.e. 09:00 till 09:30.

Note: All times are UTC.

The analysis starts with a graph showing the total QSO number in the log overlaid with the total number of QSOs being made per time of day for all stations, It’s interesting as it shows the operating pattern for the whole week.

The second graph again shows the total number of QSOs being made per time of day for all stations but this time averaged for the whole week which highlights the operating patterns such as lunch at approx 12:30 each day and then dinner at 17:30 to 18:00. No QSO were made at all about 05:30.

The third graph titled ‘Operator \[Week\] Averaged QSO Count vs Time Of Day’ shows the individual operators QSO count averaged over the whole week. This is interesting as it shows things like the majority of Colin G4ERO’s QSO were made between 23:00 and 03:00 UTC, Martin G3ZAY and Steve M1ACB were the only 2 operators to work anything between 03:30 and 06:00

After that we have all the individual operators QSO count vs time of day for each of the days of operation which clearly shows the different operating habits of each person.

This is only the first part of the log analysis and more will come with details of trends like countries worked vs time of day and similar…
