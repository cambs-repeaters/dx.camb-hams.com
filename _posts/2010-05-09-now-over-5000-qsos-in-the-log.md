At 16:30 UTC M1BXF made contact with OX/N0RC via the AO-51 satellite to put the 5000th QSO in [the log](http://dx.camb-hams.com/dx-peditions/harris-dxpedition-10/harris-2010-logbook/), at the actual time of writing we have 5070. This total includes the activation from the [Monach Islands](http://dx.camb-hams.com/dx-peditions/harris-dxpedition-10/harris-2010-monach-islands-iota-eu-111/). Unique entries, i.e. callsign vs band vs mode is 4811 so that is only 259 duplicates!

No guesses who has the highest duplicates! Comments? ðŸ™‚
