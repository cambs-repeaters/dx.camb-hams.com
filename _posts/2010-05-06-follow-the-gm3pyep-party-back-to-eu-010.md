Well done to Gav, Colin, Rob and Martin (left to right in the picture below) on their score of 1664 QSOs.

Just a reminder that they can be followed on their way back to the home base on Harris by checking on <http://aprs.fi/?call=gm3pye-10> (hint, click on the Satellite tab as there are no roads).

The home base location is <http://aprs.fi/?call=gs3pye-9>
