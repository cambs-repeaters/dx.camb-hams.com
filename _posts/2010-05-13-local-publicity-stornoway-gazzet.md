We dropped the [Stornoway Gazette](http://www.stornowaygazette.co.uk/), our local paper on the Island an email asking if they would like to come visit and do an article on us, mainly for the benefit of those who seem to stop as they drive by and have a good look, probably wondering what on earth we are doing! Well we just had a phonecall confirming they are coming tomorrow with their photographer! Time for a shower and shave I think.

6m is still going strong and we are at 260 SSB QSOs on 6m and 7755 total!
