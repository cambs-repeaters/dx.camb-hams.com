M1BXF and G8TMV have just departed Cambridge, on route to Dumbarton for a few days’ break before the DX’pedition proper sets out next Saturday.

You can see their progress on APRS.fi:

	he_zoom = 9;
// ]]></script>

(M1BXF-9 is an RF-based tracker; M1BXF-8 relies on cellular coverage – pick whichever one looks more recent!)
