We have never done schedules before as we are very adhoc in our operation which is very open to what we want to do on the day and how the HF bands are going, plus my (M1BXF) fishing schedule ![Smile](http://dx.camb-hams.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/wlEmoticon-smile.png) The general VHF operating schedule will be starting around 6pm on Saturday, all day Sunday then mornings and evenings during the week, or when there is a scheduled contact or an opening, fingers crossed.

Our preferred frequencies (all +- QRM) and modes are;

### SSB:

| **Band** | **MHz** | **Power/Elements** |
|---|---|---|
| 6m | 50.215 | 400w / 6 |
| 4m | 70.210 | 160w / 7 |
| 2m | 144.325 | 400w / 17 |

<span style="font-size: x-small">*We may transmit a CW beacon on the above frequencies when no scheduled contacts are being made.*</span>

### Data:

| **Band** | **MHz** | **Mode(s)** | **Period** | **Power/Elements** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6m | 50.235 | JT6m/ISCAT | 2nd | 400w / 6 |
| 4m | 70.230 | JT6m/ISCAT | 2nd | 160w / 7 |
| 2m | 144.375 | FSK441 | 2nd | 400w / 17 |

*<span style="font-size: x-small">Other data modes on request. The 6m and 4m antennas will both be on the same mast and therefore must point in the same direction.</span>*

Reflectors wise we will be monitoring [ON4KST](http://www.on4kst.org/chat). We will (subject to abuse) have an IRC chat running on [dx.camb-hams.com](http://webirc.attenuate.org:9090/?channels=camb-hams) and we can be emailed <skeds2012@camb-hams.com>.
