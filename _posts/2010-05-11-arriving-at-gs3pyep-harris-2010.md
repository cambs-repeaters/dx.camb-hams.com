You can see the arriving at the gate with the [CRG banner](http://www.cambridgerepeaters.net/) for those driving past to see and then the satellite antennas in the front right, the van (Flossie) with the 20/15/10m spiderbeam on it then the 4m and 6m beams on the trailer mast to the left. There are also various wire antennas in shot including 2 x 40m dipoles (right angles to each other), a full size G5RV and a 30m dipole. The 80m dipole is strung up over the loch behind the house.
