One of the 23cm EME stations I worked was Toshio JA6AHB. Toshio has very kindly donated £20 to the Camb-Hams in thanks for his QSO with GS3PYE/P in IO68. This is totally unexpected but gratefully accepted towards the cost of the trip.

Here’s a picture from his website of Toshio’s magnificent dish [http://www15.plala.or.jp/ja6ahb/](http://www15.plala.or.jp/ja6ahb/ "http://www15.plala.or.jp/ja6ahb/")
