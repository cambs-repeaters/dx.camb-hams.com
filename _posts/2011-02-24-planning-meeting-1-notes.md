So we had our first planning meeting last night (Feb 23rd) where 8 of us, not the full Arran lineup, got the first chance to run through the dx’pedition and some of the main points which came out were;

Bands of operating:

- 2 x HF voice
- 1 x HF data / HF CW
- 6m SSB and data (JT6m/ISCAT/FSK441)
- 4m SSB and data (JT6m/ISCAT/FSK441)
- 2m SSB<del> and data (FSK441)</del> We will probably only be operating 2m /P using the call GS6PYE/P.
- 2m/70cm satellites (with a working rotator this year)

Antennas will be:

- 160m – Inverter L
- 80m and 40m – 1/4 verticals
- 20m/15m/10m – Spiderbeam
- 6m – 6 element YU7EF
- 4m – 7 element YU7EF
- 2m – 17 element F9FT
- Sat antennas TBD but cross yagis

As the location of the cottage is not great for VHF to EU we propose to leave [Flossie](http://www.camb-hams.com/flossie) available for /P operation around the island. Worth mentioning we will use GS3PYE at the cottage and GS6PYE/P for portable operations.

We will also make a better effort to keep everyone updated with the radio aspect of the DX’pedition in the [Arran Diary page](http://dx.camb-hams.com/dx-peditions/arran-dxpedition-11/arran-2011-diary/) including frequencies in use etc.

Colin G8TMV will be co-ordinating [SOTA](http://www.sota.org.uk/) and is aiming to activate some of the hills never before been activated on the island.

More points to follow…
