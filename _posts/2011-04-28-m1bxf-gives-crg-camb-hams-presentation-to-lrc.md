Gavin M1BXF is an old member of the Helensburgh and District Radio Club which has since been reborn as the [Lomond Radio Club](http://www.lomondradioclub.co.uk/) (LRC) after a few venue changes. Everytime Gavin makes a trip north he tries and meet up with the members and if possible give them a presentation on something new.

After the SOTA activation Gavin M1BXF and Colin G8TMV headed down to the LRC and Gavin gave a presentation on updates from the [Cambridgeshire Repeater Group](http://www.cambridgerepeaters.net/) (CRG) and [Camb-Hams](http://www.camb-hams.com/), especially the Arran DXâ€™Pedition.
