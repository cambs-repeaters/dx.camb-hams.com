Last chance to make a sked with us before we go may be during the drive up tomorrow. Note that we may be able to rely on KST, the internet, or phone from Mull but I don’t know for certain until we get there, so if you want to be certain of   
working us on 10GHz, email me with a day and time soon.

I seem to have missed some emails from Alan GM0USI who so far is the only one who’s given us a firm date and time for a sked. That will be Monday at 1930 on   
10368.120.
