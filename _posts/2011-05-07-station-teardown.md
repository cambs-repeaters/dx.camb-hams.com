So we have to leave the cottage by 9am tomorrow, we need to be at the ferry port about 1 hour away by 10.15 so we started taking antennas down today. So far the 80m vertical is down, we still have an 80m dipole up. The Spiderbeam is gone so we have have lost 10m and 15m. The 4m and 6m beams and the 160m long wire is down.

We still have verticals up for 40m and 20m and dipoles for 80m and 30m. So tonight look for us on 80m, 40m, 30m and 20m.
