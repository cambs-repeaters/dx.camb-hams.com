I write this as we travel up the A82, wonderful scenery and great company – definitely a good start to the week!

The day dawned bright and sunny – blue skies with scattered cloud, and a brisk 7 degrees celsius as we travel along the shores of Loch Lomond on the way to the ferry port at Oban.

We’ll be doing a last shopping trip in Oban for perishables and then catching the ferry across to Mull.

As we are a larger group this year some of us decided to stay at a Travel Lodge and about half the group stayed at Gavin M1BXF’s parents last night – thanks again to their wonderful hospitality!
