Tis year the 6m beam will be mounted on the Camb-Hams /P trailer mast at 13m AGL. The mast itself is 10m and it is at this point we mount the Ham IV rotator and above the rotator will be a 4m pole which we normally put both the 6m and 4m beams on. This year we are putting 4m beam onto Flossie’s 20m mast and will mount the 6m beam near the top of the trailer mast pole at about 13m and above it a Solarcom imax-2000 vertical for 10m.

This leaves lots of potential movement above the rotator on a windy day so we have decided to support it using a slip-ring.

We are using a Yaesu GS-065 which comes with handy guy rope mounts and to connect to them 4 runs of 8mm nylon rope terminated with thimbles and D shackles which will make assembly much easier.

This preparatory work I can not stress enough. The few hours effort back home means we know the guy connections will be good whoever connects them to the guy points, no worries about bad knots, and the time to assemble and pack away is much reduced, which if the weather is poor at setup or teardown you’ll be very much appreciative of the effort you put in before setting off.

As there are 2 guy points on the 6m mast, the lower one is at the rotator 10m up and the second will be at the guy slip ring 3.5m above that. As such we have 2 different lengths of guy rope, the tops ones are 23m and are marked with “TOP”, the bottom ones are 20m.

Originally John G4BAO made this up a guys slip ring before I opened my new GS-065 box to find Yaesu supplies the rope attachments.

My only concern with Johns design is the stress on the right angles, this thickness of extruded aluminium should be OK, however the supplied Yaesu parts seem better and less likely to fail, this is just me being over cautious.
