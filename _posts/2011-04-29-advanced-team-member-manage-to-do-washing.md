Unlike last years #fail (<http://dx.camb-hams.com/2010/05/09/terry-g3vfc-can-work-pileups-cant-do-washing/>) Gavin M1BXF and Colin G8TMV have managed to work out how to use Gavinâ€™s mum washing machine and successfully put all weeks worth of dirty clothes through a full wash cycle and hang them out to dry.

To prove this is not a hoax photo evidence is attached!
