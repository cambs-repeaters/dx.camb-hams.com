![James M1TES](http://dx.camb-hams.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/James-M1TES-300x224.jpg)We are extremely grateful to [Freshpac Ltd](http://freshpac.co.uk) in Halesworth for sponsoring our DXpedition again this year. They have very generously supplied us with a huge ‘sack’ of high quality tea, to compliment the excellent coffee they gave us last year. Camb-Hams consume an enormous amount of tea and coffee during our DXpeditions, so this is a very important sponsorship deal for us.

James M1TES, who works at [Freshpac](http://freshpac.co.uk), presented the tea to Steve M1ACB at the South Anglia <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Repeater Group AGM in return for </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">a custom made Camb-Hams Mull 2015 mug.</span>
