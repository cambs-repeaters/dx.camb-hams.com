So this morning Dominic M0BLF had a different type of sked to keep, this one was with Jeremy Sallis on the BBC Radio Cambridge breakfast show. Dominic was live on the show just before 07:00 GMT.

You can hear Dominicâ€™s QSO with Jeremy on [BBC iPlayer](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p00r3jr0/Cambridgeshire_Breakfast_with_Jeremy_Sallis_03_05_2012/?t=1h55m32s) which starts at 1h55m32s into the program (the link should take you there).
