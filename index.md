Welcome to the Camb-Hams DXpedition site. Here you’ll read all about our adventures, trips and activities operating Amateur Radio from locations such as Harris, Arran, Mull and other Scottish Isles. We’ll also post pictures and videos, and during our trips we will have our logbook updating in real-time.

## Islay 2023

We're back on [Islay]({% link dx-peditions/islay-2023.md %}) for 2023. We'll be on air Sunday 30th April to Saturday 6th May, on HF and the narrowband QO-100 transponder.

## Skye 2022

After two years missed due to Covid, we finally made it to the [Isle of Skye]({% link dx-peditions/isle-of-skye-30th-april-6th-may-2022.md %}) in May 2022.

## Isle of Man 2019

Departing from our normal tradition of the Scottish Islands, in 2019 we operated as GT3PYE/P from the [Isle of Man]({% link dx-peditions/gt3pye-p-isle-of-man-4-11-may-2019.md %}).

## Islay 2018

A second visit to Claggan Farmhouse on the [Isle of Islay]({% link dx-peditions/isle-of-islay-dxpedition-12th-19th-may-2018.md %}) - more distilleries to visit, and more QSOs to make.

## Islay 2017

Our first visit to the [Isle of Islay]({% link dx-peditions/isle-of-islay-6th-13th-may-2017.md %}). As well as our usual GS3PYE/P operation, we activated all the SOTA summits on Islay, and all WAB squares in a week of excellent weather.

Five years after first visiting the [Isle of Arran]({% link dx-peditions/arran-2016.md %}), we returned to enjoy excellent propagation to North America - albeit with plenty of ticks and midges!
