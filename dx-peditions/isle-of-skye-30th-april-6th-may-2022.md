Three years since the last activation in Scotland, delayed twice by COVID-19, GS3PYE/P returns to the Scottish islands!

## Dates

We begin our journey from Cambridge on Friday 29th April, reaching Skye late afternoon on 30th April. We expect to be active on some bands by Saturday evening, with more following on the Sunday.

We will then be QRV through the week before dismantling the stations on Friday 6th May.

## Stations

This year, we’re expecting a similar setup to before:

- 4x HF stations covering 80m to 10m (and possibly 160m), with linear amplifiers developing up to 400W.
- 6m, and 2m will focus on SSB &amp; MGM (datamodes), with skeds welcome via ON4KST chat. We’ll also be active in the 2m UKAC on Tuesday 3rd May (1900-2130 UTC).
- SSB and via the Es’hail-2 / QO-100 satellite
- Select LEO satellites using hand-held antennas and low power
