The Camb-Hams were formed in early 2006 as the social and public-facing side of the [Cambridgeshire Repeater Group](http://www.cambridgerepeaters.net/) (CRG). The Camb-Hams are made up of people from many of, but not exclusively, the various Cambridge radio groups including [CUWS](http://www.g6uw.org/) (Cambridge University Wireless Society), [CDARC](http://www.cdarc.co.uk/) (Cambridge and District Amateur Radio Club) and [Cambridge RAYNET](http://www.cambridgeshire-raynet.net/).

The **Camb-Hams** are off to the **Isle of Arran** for the **2011 DX’Pedition**. The dates will be from **May 1st till May 8th 2011** from a cottage on the west of the island near [Balliekine IO75HO](http://goo.gl/maps/Y21e). As usual, most HF bands will be activated with SSB, data and some CW (but please be patient!). VHF operations will be on 6m and 4m SSB/data (JT6m), and being a little more south than [Harris](http://dx.camb-hams.com/dx-peditions/harris-dxpedition-10/), we will also activate 2m both SSB/data (FSK441). We may also have time for 2m and 70cm satellites.

Some portable VHF activations will be done around the island with the group’s portable operating shack [Flossie](http://www.camb-hams.com/flossie). This year the CRG has a new callsign – G6PYE – which we will use alongside the traditional G3PYE. As the activation is in Scotland, the prefix becomes GS for a club station in Scotland, so listen out for both GS3PYE/P and GS6PYE/P.
