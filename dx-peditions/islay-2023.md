# Islay 2023

After last year's road-only journey to the Isle of Skye, 2023 brings a return to CalMac's ferries and their Scottish Breakfast.

## Dates

We set out from Cambridge on Saturday 29th April, stopping over in Dumbarton near Glasgow overnight, travelling on to Islay on Sunday morning.

After setting up antennas on the afternoon of Sunday 30th April, we'll be on air until packing down on the afternoon of Saturday 6th May.

## Stations

As we approach the peak of the solar cycle, we'll be concentrating on HF with five stations each equipped with linear amplifiers, as well as using the narrow-band transponder on the geostationary QO-100 satellite.

We may also operate via LEO satellites using hand-held equipment, as well as activating SOTA summits on Islay and Jura under our own callsigns.

Here’s a sample of our equipment:

- **HF**
    - Elecraft K3 transceivers
    - Icom IC-7610 transceiver
    - Elecraft KPA-500 amplifiers
    - 5B4AGN and DuneStar transmitting band-pass filters
    - Hexbeam for 20m – 10m
    - YU7EF mono-band yagis for 10 or 15m
    - 1/4 verticals and horizontal dipoles on 80, 40, 30, and 20m
    - Vertical dipoles on 17 and 15m
- **QO-100**
