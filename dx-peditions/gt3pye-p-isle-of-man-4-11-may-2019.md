After a decade of visiting the Scottish Islands, we’re heading to a different DXCC this year: the Isle of Man, GD.

## Dates

With a shorter journey from Cambridgeshire this year, we’re aiming to complete it all in one day: leaving home around 6am on Saturday 4th May for a midday ferry crossing from Heysham, bringing us on to the island by early evening. Most of the rest of the day will be setting up – we don’t expect to be on air much on Saturday.

We will then be QRV through the week before dismantling the stations on Friday 10th May.

## Stations

This year, we’re expecting a similar setup to before:

- 4x HF stations covering 160m to 10m, with linear amplifiers developing up to 400W.
- 6m, 4m and 2m will focus on SSB &amp; MGM (datamodes), with skeds welcome via ON4KST chat, we plan to use the following QRGs: 
    - 6m: meteor scatter using MSK144 on 50.285 MHz; FT-8 on 50.313 MHz.
    - 4m meteor scatter using FSK441/MSK144 on 70.174 MHz; FT-8 on 70.154 MHz (use ON4KST to request a different QRG if required).
    - 2m meteor scatter using FSK441/MSK144 on 144.365 MHz; JTMS on 144.184 MHz; FT-8 on 144.174 MHz.
- 2m and 70cm satellites
- SSB and video via the Es’hail-2 / QO-100 satellite
