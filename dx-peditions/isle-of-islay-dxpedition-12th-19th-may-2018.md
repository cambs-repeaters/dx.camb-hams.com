## Timings

After a stop-over in Dumbarton on Friday 11th May, catching up with local amateurs and breaking the journey, we headed to Kennacraig for the ferry to Islay. We’re hoping to be operational properly on Sunday 13th May.

We will then be QRV through the week before dismantling the stations on Friday 18th.

## Stations

This year, we’re expecting a similar setup to before:

- 4-6 HF stations covering 160m to 10m, most with linear amplifiers developing up to 400W.
- 6m, 4m and 2m will focus on datamodes, with skeds welcome via ON4KST chat: 
    - 6m meteor scatter: 50.285 MHz; FT-8 50.313 MHz
    - 4m metoer scatter and FT-8 – ON4KST for skeds.
    - 2m meteor scatter: 144.365 MHz; FT-8 144.174 MHz
- 2m and 70cm satellites

## Takeoff

In the past, especially Arran, we didn’t have the best location for VHF. This year however the opposite is true.

Here is the horizon, as seen from 40ft up at the cottage (note the upper orange line is 1deg);

Using ‘[SRTM Path Profile](http://www.mike-willis.com/software.html)’ this is what the coverage looks like for an HT at 2m above ground, bodes well for beams at 40ft.
