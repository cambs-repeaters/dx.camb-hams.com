Four years after the first DX’pedition, we’re back to Mull!

Continuing the Camb-Hams traditional Scottish Island activations, beginning with Mull in 2008, Harris in 2009 and 2010, and Arran in 2011, we’ve decided to return to the Isle of Mull in the Scottish Inner Hebrides (**IOTA EU-008**). But where the first year was part-time operation of a single station, in a cottage at the *base* of some cliffs blocking the path to North America, this year we’re going for something bigger…

- All HF bands from 160m to 10m covered with five stations on air simultaneously, all capable of running the legal power limit from five linear amplifiers
- 6m, 4m and 2m with a great take-off to the UK and Europe, again all at legal limit
- 10GHz (3cm) for a first-time activation of IO66 square

Equipment wise, here’s a taster:

- 3 \* Icom IC-756ProIII transceivers (2 on HF, one on 6m)
- 3 \* Elecraft K3 transceivers on HF
- Icom IC-910 transceiver for 2m
- Yaesu VL-1000 “Quadra” linear for 6m
- Expert 1K-FA HF linear
- Kenwood TL-922 HF linear
- Linear Amp UK Ranger 811 HF linear
- Ten-Tec solid-state HF linear
- Icom IC-2KL solid-state HF linear
- 800W solid-state or 500W valve 2m linear (construction pending)
- 300W solid-state linear and OZ2M transverter on 4m, FLEX-1500 driver
- 10GHz DB6NT transverter with 10W amplifier
- 5B4AGN and DuneStar transmitting band-pass filters

We’ll be on air from **Saturday 28th April** until **Friday 4th May**.

The main station will be located in **IO66vh**, on the south coast of the island:

There will also be a 24 hour activation from **Lunga, IOTA EU-108** using the callsign GS6PYE/P. This will most likely take place from **Sunday 29th** until **Monday 30th April** – exact timings to follow.
