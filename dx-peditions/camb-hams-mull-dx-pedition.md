<span style="font-size: x-small;">Info about the CAMB-HAMS DX-pedition to the </span>[<span style="font-size: x-small;">Isle of Mull</span>](http://www.isle.of.mull.com/)<span style="font-size: x-small;"> between April 26th to May 3rd 2008. The diary can be read [here](http://www.camb-hams.com/coming-events/camb-hams-mull-dx-pedition/the-mull-diary).</span>

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Overview</span>**

<span style="font-size: x-small;">The Camb-Hams sat at one </span>[<span style="font-size: x-small;">pie and pint</span>](http://www.camb-hams.com/coming-events)<span style="font-size: x-small;"> in late 2007 and decided we had to do some IOTA, SOTA, WAB or VHF portable operation in 2008. Suggested locations were made for SOTA, others for WAB or VHF and many ideas were mentioned for which island(s) to activate for IOTA, most of which were tropical! It was then realized that we can do it all on the </span>[<span style="font-size: x-small;">Isle of Mull</span>](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=isle+of+mull&ie=UTF8&ll=56.656226,-5.317383&spn=4.313004,10.129395&z=7)<span style="font-size: x-small;">. At this point the Camb-Hams DX-pedition to the Isle of Mull was born.</span><span style="font-size: x-small;">We plan to be predominantly operational on most HF bands (inc. 5Mhz), 6m and 2m. We will also have the capability for 4m and 70cm operation, but will only be QRV if there is enough demand. Please see the sections below for more information on each operating section. The G3PYE call sign which will be used from base camp belongs the CRG (</span>[<span style="font-size: x-small;">Cambridgeshire Repeater Group</span>](http://www.cambridgerepeaters.net/)<span style="font-size: x-small;">) and as the activation is in Scotland the prefix becomes GM3PYE/P or</span><span style="font-size: x-small;"> GS3PYE/P, both of which will be used. SOTA, WAB and VHF operation from IO66 will be under the operators own call sign, they are listed below in the ‘Operators’ section. Please see the QSL information at the bottom if you are interested in a QSL response.</span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Base camp is at Carsaig on the south coast of the island, OS ref NM545215, lat/long 56.19.31N 5.58.53W, IOTA group EU-008, WAB NM52 and maidenhead square IO76ah.

[![ICOM_LOGO](http://www.camb-hams.com/wp-content/uploads/icom-logo-thumb.jpg)](http://www.camb-hams.com/wp-content/uploads/icom-logo.jpg)<span style="font-size: x-small;">ICOM are in on the act! They are supporting us and have provided an IC-756pro3 + PSU + speaker, an IC-7000 and an IC-703 for the DX-pedition. </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Many thanks to </span>[<span style="font-size: x-small;">Ian Lockyer</span>](mailto:IanL@icomuk.co.uk)<span style="font-size: x-small;"> and the team down in Herne Bay for this support!</span><span style="font-size: x-small;">On top of this we will have an a second IC-756proIII, an FT-847, an FT-897D an IC-910H, a VHF amp, an HF amp plus a handful of FT-817D’s (for SOTA).</span>

## **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">HF</span>**

<span style="font-size: x-small;">We plan to run on 2 band simultaneously. The HF stations will consist of 2 x Icom IC-756proIII radios, one will be running into a Ranger amplifier. The antennas will be a full-sized G5RV, 20m 1/4wave vertical and a 40m 1/4wave vertical. Verticals are mainly being used due to the small area required to erect them. One station will be running CW and the other SSB, both will be used for datamodes at various times to give RTTY, PSK31 and SSTV operators a chance to work us – keep an eye on the DX clusters.</span>

## <span style="text-decoration: underline;">**WAB**</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">We plan to work as many WAB squares as possible while on the island. There are 25 WAB squares available but we think 3 of them (NM23, NM33 &amp; NM61) will be difficult to activate. Listen out for us on the rest, mainly under the operators own call sign /M. Base camp is in NM52. More details of the dates and times of operation will appear once we have a good idea of the weather. If you have demand for a particular WAB square please send us an email at </span>[<span style="font-size: x-small;">mull-skeds@camb-hams.com</span>](mailto:mull-skeds@camb-hams.com)<span style="font-size: x-small;"> and we will endeavor to prioritise the most popular squares.</span>[![WAB](http://www.camb-hams.com/wp-content/uploads/wab-thumb.jpg)](http://www.camb-hams.com/wp-content/uploads/wab.jpg)

## **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">IOTA</span>**

<span style="font-size: x-small;">The Isle of Mull falls into the Inner Hebrides group in IOTA. It’s reference is EU-008. At the time of writing EU-008 has been worked by 36.1% of IOTA participants.</span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Also on the cards is a trip to Treshnish, IOTA reference EU-108. Only claimed by 19.8% of IOTA participants so this is going to be a welcomed activation by many. Unfortunately due to the logistics of the trip we will only be able to activate Treshnish for around 6 hours. It’s still weather dependant but we currently plan to activate it on Wednesday 30th April 2008 so listen out for us. A more accurate activation schedule will appear a few days before going…</span>

## **<span style="text-decoration: underline;">VHF</span>**

<span style="font-size: x-small;">We will be active on 6m and 2m for most of the time while on the island. We will be capable of 4m and 70cm activity but will only setup the 4m and 70cm stations if there is enough demand. Radios in use will be an FT-897D or FT-847 for 6m and 4m and an IC-910H for 2m and 70cm. Antennas will be a 5ele Tonna beam on 6m, 4ele Jaybeam on 4m, a 17ele Tonna beam on 2m and a 22ele Tonna beam on 70cm, all will be mounted on our 10m </span>[<span style="font-size: x-small;">trailer mast</span>](http://www.camb-hams.com/gallery/v/various/Trailer+Mast/)<span style="font-size: x-small;"> but due to size restrictions only 2 antennas can be mounted at any time.</span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Base camp is just in the western edge of IO76 but we also plan to do some /P operation from IO66. SSB, JT6m and FSK441 will be the preferred modes on all VHF/UHF bands and skeds are welcome to </span>[<span style="font-size: x-small;">mull-skeds@camb-hams.com</span>](mailto:mull-skeds@camb-hams.com)<span style="font-size: x-small;">. If we have internet access you will find us on </span>[<span style="font-size: x-small;">ON4KST chat</span>](http://www.on4kst.com/chat/start.php)<span style="font-size: x-small;"> (GS3PYE/P) or MSN <IM@Camb-Hams.Com>. If there is no internet access then any requests for skeds during the trip will be forwarded onto us by other means such as directly over the radio!</span>
