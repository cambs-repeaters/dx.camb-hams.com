<span style="font-size: x-small;">**Tuesday 10th June 2008**</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">We have now scanned most of the QSL cards received which can be found </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">[here](http://www.camb-hams.com/wpg2-2?g2_itemId=9352)</span><span style="font-size: x-small;">.</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">**Saturday 17th May 2008**</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">Pictures from the trip are now available [here](http://www.camb-hams.com/wpg2-2?g2_itemId=3131).</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">**Thursday 8th May 2008**</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">We are already starting to get lots of QSL cards arriving :o) Currently we are choosing the best photo (out of thousands) to use on our return card to make it special so please bear with us. The feeling amongst us is that the trip went really well and everyone enjoyed themselves. We are already thinking of what we will be doing next year. Also we have already had requests from local clubs for presentations about the dx’pedition the dates of which we will post here if you wish to come along.</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">As always, if you have any questions don’t hesitate to email us [<span style="font-size: x-small;">mull-info@camb-hams.com</span>](mailto:mull-info@camb-hams.com)</span>

## <span style="font-size: x-small;">**Saturday 3 May 2008**</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">We are all home safely after a 13 hour drive back from Mull to Cambridge. The VHF station was disassembled early on Friday afternoon due to unfavorable weather being forecast and the last HF contact was around 10pm on Friday night. Initial QSO figures for the trip look around 800 on HF SSB, 70 on HF PSK31, 55 on 2m SSB/FSK441 and 45 on 4m/6m SSB/JT6m. On top of this there were around 260 QSOs made on the Isle of Lunga (EU-108) on Wednesday and Friday, around 50 from Staffa on Friday and many more from the /p stations and SOTA stations during the week. Full (and accurate) figures will be published as soon as possible, along with photos.</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">Can I take this opportunity to thank John M0EAV, our 11th member, for keeping the website updated and giving us all the support we needed when on the island. John couldn’t make it as his wife is expecting their first child in 2 weeks time…</span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Thanks again to all the stations who called us and made the trip worthwhile, especially those who passed on good wishes – keep an eye out for our next activation.</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">**Friday 2 May 2008**</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">GM0BOE and GM4HUN are on their way to Lunga, Island of Treshnish. They should be QRZ on 14.260 +/- QRM at about 1430 local time (1330 UTC) as GM0BOE/p. They are hoping to work from Staffa (still Inner Hebrides EU-008) for about 45 minutes at lunchtime whilst waiting for the ferry. Listen out for GM4HUN/p around 14.260 +/- QRM.</span><span style="font-size: x-small;">QSL for both calls via G4HUN as before.</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">***Friday pm update***</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">Neil and Voi had a good day racking up 40 QSOs in 45 minutes from Staffa (EU-008) and 108 QSOs from Lunga, Treshnish (EU-108) including contacts as far away as Alaska and Japan. </span> <span style="font-size: x-small;">Allan, MM1BJP, was out and about on a last ditched effort to activate some more SOTA summits and managed over 40 contacts from Beinn na Croise, SI-067! </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Time flies when your having fun, as the saying goes and the team are now beginning to pack everything away ready for the journey back south to Cambridgeshire on Saturday morning. The team will be QRV on HF this evening, probably 80m, using the Icom 756ProIII and the G5RV.</span> <span style="font-size: x-small;">I’m sure this will be said again upon the teams return but I would like to express, on behalf of The Camb Hams Mull Expedition Team, a big THANK-YOU to all the stations that contacted them during this past week and a special thank-you to all those who assisted in making this trip happen, including Icom for the sponsorship of a number of radios. Don’t forget to check back later for more photographs and the finals scores!! </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">So from me, M0EAV, thank-you all for taking part and for reading these updates. 73 for now…</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">**Thursday 1 May 2008**</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">A quiet day for the team as most went on a sightseeing trip to Tobermory. However, Allan, MM1BJP/p, activated another SOTA summit of Corra-bheinn, SI-031. Voi, GM0BOE/p, went on a general tour of the island and some of you may have found on various bands during the day! This evening, the Carsaig Radio Group (CRG!!) are venturing out to the local Reef Restaurant, a short journey of a mere 8 miles!!</span><span style="font-size: x-small;">As tomorrow is the last on air day of the expedition, the team are looking to give the bands a damn good thrashing! Look out for them on 80m, 40m and 20m. It’s best to keep an eye on your favorite dx cluster for specifics.</span>

<span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: x-small;">***BREAKING NEWS***</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">Voi, GM0BOE, and Neil, GM4HUN, have decided to make a second journey to Lunga, part of the Treshnish Isles, tomorrow (Friday 2 May) assuming the weather will let them. Activation times will be about the same due to ferry timings so keep an ear out for them on 14.260MHz (+/- QRM) SSB at around 1430 local time. Check this page again on Friday morning as they hope to contact me and confirm these plans.</span>

**<span style="font-size: x-small;">Wednesday 30 April</span> 2008**

<span style="font-size: x-small;">A small team of Camb-Hams are on their way to Lunga, part of the Treshnish Isles (EU-108). They hope to be QRV on 80m or 40m and 20m this afternoon. Keep your eye on the dx clusters for more information.</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">***Wednesday pm update***</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">Just heard from the Treshnish mini expedition team… Neil, GM4HUN/p, Gavin, MM1BXF/p, Rob, MM1XZG/p and Voi, GM0BOE/p notched up a whopping 150 contacts from Lunga on the Island of Treshnish (EU-108). Contacts as far as US, Canada, Cyprus and Japan were made despite unfavorable weather conditions including heavy static rain and all in less than 2 hours!! Just a quick reminder, QSL for all contacts via G4HUN, please see bottom of this page for more info).</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">The final news for the day is that the HF amp is still unserviceable after the replacement valves didn’t arrive. So much for Next Day Delivery, although I don’t suppose they had the middle of nowhere in mind when they quoted that!!</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">**Tuesday 29 April 2008**</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">Latest Update – Yesterday saw a mammoth 14 hour run on 3.750 resulting in a large pile-up of mainly UK and European stations. The team gave regular intervals where only M3 and QRP stations were invited to call in, giving everybody an opportunity to get into the log! Many CRG members have contacted the Team including Martyn (M1MAJ), Caroline (M3ZCB), Eddy (M5PYE/m), Howard (G0AYE), Ben (G6YQJ), Mike G7VJR and, of course, myself, M0EAV!</span> <span style="font-size: x-small;">Today sees another SOTA mini-expedition for Allan, MM1BJP, who is looking to provide activations on both HF and 2m bands of Beinn na Sreine, SI-061 and Coirc Bheinn, SI-055. A small team are also activating the IO66 grid square on 2m SSB with the addition of some of the local WAB squares on HF.</span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Wednesday is the planned excursion to Treshnish (IOTA EU-108), the hope is to be QRV on 20m (14.260 +/- QRM) by mid afternoon.</span>

<span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: x-small;">***HOT NEWS***</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">Disaster struck today as the HF Amplifier decided to leave the land of the living and go offline. Currently the team are running the native 100 watt maximum (although they were only running 200 watt previously, so not too much of an issue!). However, with the efforts of Darren, G7LWT, sourcing replacement valves, the team expect to have the amplifier back up and running by the end of Wednesday.</span>

**<span style="font-size: x-small;">The team wishes to express a huge thank-you to Darren, G7LWT for his assistance in obtaining these replacement valves.</span>**

<span style="font-size: x-small;">**Monday 28 April 2008**</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">The team has made a few adjustments to the mast and they now have the 4m Jaybeam up. They have had some success with 4m contacts into Europe. The HF bands appear very quiet so the team have been concentrating on 80m and all modes on VHF/UHF. </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Below are a few early pictures sent by mobile MMS messages </span><span style="font-size: x-small;">so I apologize if the quality is a little bit lower than what you would expect.</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">**Sunday 27 April 2008**</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">The Camb Hams Mull expedition have been active on almost all bands today (Sunday 27th) running pretty much all modes. 80, 40, 20 and 17m seem to have been most favored HF bands on voice, cw and data. They have also been active on VHF with 6m and 2m data and voice. 2m SSB seems to have been most successful with contacts into Devon and a spotter as far away as Hungary! A promising start to the week. Currently the most significant contacts have been with DG6JF/p @ 561 miles on 2m and OE5MPL @ 1007 miles on 6m.</span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Summits on the Air (SOTA) also saw a number of activations from the team. Allan, MM1BJP, did a sterling job of activating three summits today. These were Ben More, SI-003, the first time in nearly 2 years, Beinn a’Ghraig, SI-043, for the first activation of this summit and Beinn Fhada, SI-034, a summit last activated in Oct 2005! Dave, MM0VMC, Neil, GM4HUN and Voi, GM0BOE were not to be outdone and activated Beinn Chreagach, SI-123 using 2m FM, another summit that has now had its first ever activation! All in all, a great day for the SOTA teams.</span><span style="font-size: x-small;">The team is intending to carry out WAB mini-expeditions on Tuesday (obviously weather permitting!), hoping to cover as many of the squares as possible.</span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Keep checking this page for more news from the island. The team will be updating me as often as possible, apparently mobile phone signals can be described as intermittent at best! </span>
