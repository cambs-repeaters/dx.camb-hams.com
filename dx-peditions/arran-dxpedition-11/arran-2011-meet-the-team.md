Meet the operators behind the mics, keys, and keyboards… and see if you can spot the common theme…

## Pete, 2E0SQL

Interested in contesting (SSB &amp; RTTY) and digital communications (PSK31, RTTY), this last year became rather hooked on satellite communications and can be found on FM/SSB satellites most afternoons. More info at http://www.m3php.com.

Likes custard.

## Bob, G1SAA

I’ve been licensed since 1986, and in that 25 years, I’ve done a lot of different things within the radio hobby.

I’m active from my home QTH, and able to work all bands from 160m-10m on HF, and 6m/2m/70cm/23cm on VHF/UHF.

I’m interested in custard and datamodes on HF and 6m, and some SSTV on 2m. I’m also active on 23cm ATV, and use the local ATV repeater, GB3PV, near Cambridge.

## Martin, G3ZAY

An IOTA enthusiast and President of the Cambridge University Wireless Society, Martin’s previous DX’pedition destinations include ZD7, ZD8, FP, VP8, TF, and many others. He’s a keen HF operator, who is on occasion coerced, usually kicking and screaming, into VHF land – the promise of custard usually helps!

## Terry, G3VFC

Licensed 1966 – apprenticeship in radio/TV repair (Rentaset/Radio Rentals); BBC Broadcast Engineer 1970 – 2007 (retired)

Enjoys basic engineering/construction/operating on any band which supports conversation. Also in Raynet, and enjoys sitting in a warm sunny spot – not so keen in the wind, rain or snow.

Most happy discussing the whys and whynots of how things work, especially with somebody else trying to do the same.

Rather happy building sheds (3) and workbenches to go in them (run out of fingers to count them now).

Married with two sons – both licensed, both of whom wave their arms in the air when enthusing over something – cars, kites and scouts in one case and amateur radio in the other. Both into computers somehow, which G3VFC is not. Very much.

XYL very supportive but doesn’t enjoy these technical things so much.

Lucky…

Likes custard.

## Colin, G4ERO

The force behind many of the Camb-Hams’ VHF antennas, Colin’s engineering skills continue to amaze us! Along with the 6m and 4m beams in use on this trip, he also led the construction of an array of four 47-ele 23cm beams, each with its elements cut and positioned within a fraction of a millimetre.

After joining the Camb-Hams’ Harris DX’pedition in 2010, including the trip to the Monach Islands, Colin is back this year for more – more radio, more CW, and more custard!

## Colin, G8TMV

Almost 60, interested in vintage technologies (steam trains etc.) and open source software. Licensed since 1979, ham interests including home brew construction (the latest project being an ATS-3B HF transceiver in an Altoids tin), contesting, custard and SOTA.

## Lawrence, M0LCM

I’ve been into electronics since an early age, and becoming a licensed radio ham has meant more opportunities to do practical things with that interest. I enjoy contesting, data modes, experimenting with new computer interfaced radio equipment, and custard. What’s been great about getting into ham radio in Cambridge is the number of great people locally into diverse areas of the hobby, allowing me to explore many different areas.

When not playing radio, I’m generally doing something with a computer, or a camera, and when the weather is good and I have an opportunity, doing some historical diving (see http://www.thehds.com for details). Definitely a gadget freak – be it computer, photographic, radio or diving, I’ve probably got it or want it!

## Mark, M0MJH

My main interest lies in HF operation, mainly SSB at the moment but I am learning morse. I also use PSK31 and SSTV on HF from time to time but it is a rarity!

I have also gotten interested in backpack HF and am experimenting with various aerials and bits for that. Go to www.hfpack.com for more info on backpack radio. I am quite keen on mobile operating. I have nearly worked all continents when /m. I worked most of Europe, North &amp; South America, Africa and Asia in a 2 hour period one day, not bad for 50w SSB (under my 2E1 licence) and a ‘hamstick’. I have also done PSK31/m (don’t worry, I wasn’t driving at the time!) – I confused the hell out of a few people!

Occasionally, people have forced me to eat some custard.

## Rob, M0VFC

First licensed in 1996 as 2E1EVJ, age 11, Rob somehow took another 13 years to get around to upgrading to M0VFC. A software engineer by day, he enjoys many sides of the amateur radio hobby – from HF and VHF contesting, to chatting on the local repeaters, supporting the local Raynet group, a little direction finding when time allows, and anything else that sounds like fun. He’s also a member of the Cambridge University Wireless Society, G6UW / M4A.

Likes: HF, VHF, software development, custard

## Steve, M1ACB

RSGB Deputy Regional Manager for Suffolk, a Member of F&amp;DARS, MRS, IRC, ESWR, DMU ARS, Camb-Hams, ARRL and the RSGB.

My interest in radio contesting started with the RSGB Backpackers contests 1997-99. I’ve since enjoyed being part of winning team entries in the 2003-06 RSGB VHF NFD contests, 2004-06 RSGB 80m Club Championships and the 2008-10 RSGB 80m Club Sprints. I enjoy the occasional bit of teaching for the amateur radio exams and chatting on the HF bands when I have the time. I’ve recently become interested in D-Star digital amateur radio, usually taking it (and some custard) with me when I travel.

I’m very happy to be joining a Camb-Hams dxpedition for the first time this year.

## Gavin, M1BXF

I’m mainly interesting in the technical aspect of the hobby and using the privileges my license gives me to design, build and test new homebrew projects and electronic gizzmi-what-sits. I don’t think I own anything radio related I haven’t modified or in my opinion improved (or destroyed and then repaired!).

When operating from home I am usually found on 6m to 23cm where my preferred operating modes are weak signal WSJT digital modes like FSK441, JT6m, JT65b and those involving custard. I also have HF capabilities and can occasionally be found on FM/SSB satellites.

I’ve been active as MM1BXF and OK8BXF in the past. More info at http://www.geekshed.co.uk/
