<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: small;">**From The Island**</span></span>

<span style="font-size: small;">The Camb-Hams 2009 dx‚Äôpedition is now over üôÅ See how we got on</span><span style="font-size: small;"> on the diary page </span>[here](http://dx.camb-hams.com/dx-peditions/harris-dxpedition-09/harris-2009-diary/)<span style="font-size: small;">.</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">To see if you have worked us on Harris or to see who we have been working then please look at out online logbook </span>[<span style="font-size: x-small;">**here**</span>](http://www.camb-hams.com/coming-events/2009-dxpedition/harris-logbook)<span style="font-size: x-small;">.</span>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: small;">**Overview**</span></span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">After a very successful </span>[<span style="font-size: x-small;">Dx‚Äôpedition in 2008</span>](http://www.camb-hams.com/camb-hams-mull-dx-pedition)<span style="font-size: x-small;"> to the Island of Mull the Camb-Hams have decided on another DX‚ÄôPedition for 2009. We have agreed on the Island of Harris for this years location which is off the north west coast of Scotland. The format of the trip will be the similar to last year, where we shall have stations on HF voice and data, most bands inc 5Mhz, alongside 6m, 4m, 2m and possibly 70cm (SSB, JT6m and MS). There will be lots of portable operation around the islands (possible interest to WAB chasers) and 3 very energetic climbers activating SOTA summits all week.</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">The callsign for the trip will be the CRG (</span>[<span style="font-size: x-small;">Cambridgeshire Repeater Group</span>](http://www.cambridgerepeaters.net/)<span style="font-size: x-small;">) callsign G3PYE, as the activation is in Scotland the prefix becomes GM3PYE/P or GS3PYE/P, both of which will be used.</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">We plan to be active on during the week starting April 20th, this might mean we get on-air during the leading Saturday 18th of April till Saturday 25th of April. You can follow our escapades in the [Harris Diary](http://dx.camb-hams.com/dx-peditions/harris-dxpedition-09/harris-2009-diary/)</span><span style="font-size: x-small;">.</span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">If you would like to make a sked with us for any of the VHF bands (voice or data) please email </span>[<span style="font-size: x-small;">skeds@camb-hams.com</span>](mailto:skeds@camb-hams.com)

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: small;">**Location**</span></span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">Basecamp is a holiday cottage near Liceasto at the head of Loch Stockinish on the East side of the </span>[<span style="font-size: x-small;">Island of Harris</span>](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=57.821355,-6.915894&daddr=&hl=en&geocode=&mra=mi&mrsp=0&sz=8&sll=57.571834,-6.470947&sspn=2.247664,7.086182&ie=UTF8&z=8)<span style="font-size: x-small;">. It has a good view to EU and a reasonable path through the hills to USA. The locator is IO67nt.</span>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: small;">**Final List of people on the DX 2009 Trip**</span></span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">Alan 2M0TXY (official photographer), Allan MM1BJP (Mountain goat), Colin Tea Boy (Alcoholic and barman), Jim (Allan and Colin‚Äôs Dad &amp; Cook!), Bob G1SAA (equipment supplier), Geoff G0DDX (data mode man), Neil G4HUN (wall of sound), Seamus 2M0OVV (DJ and entertainment), Neil Alan C‚Äôs friend (navy lad), Rob M0VFC (ex 2E0EVJ ‚Äì all rounder), Voi G0BOE (what can I say, bring some spare valves this time), Gavin M1BXF (VHF mad).</span>

<span style="font-size: small;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">**HF**</span></span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">Like last year we are planning to run on 2 band simultaneously, one voice and one data, Geoff G0DDX and Rob M0VFC have built and tuned bandpass filters for 80m, 40m, 20m, and 15m for this purpose. The HF stations will consist of an Icom IC-756proIII for SSB and an Icom 706Mk2 for data. SSB will be at legal limit using a Ranger amplifier. The antennas will be a full-sized G5RV, 20m, 15m and 10m spiderbeam, a 20m 1/4wave vertical and a 40m vertical. Verticals are mainly being used due to the small area required to erect them and the chance of some good DX. Keep an eye on the DX clusters to see which bands we are working on at any given time.</span>

#### <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">**IOTA**</span></span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">The Isle of Harris falls into the Outer Hebrides group in IOTA. It‚Äôs reference is </span>[<span style="font-size: x-small;">EU-010</span>](http://www.rsgbiota.org/info/groupinfo.php?refno=EU-010)<span style="font-size: x-small;">. At the time of writing EU-010 has been worked by 66.8% of IOTA participants which doesn‚Äôt make it rare! Most of the portable operation this year will also be from EU-010. There was some talk about a visit to the Monach Islands </span>[<span style="font-size: x-small;">EU-111</span>](http://www.rsgbiota.org/info/groupinfo.php?refno=EU-111)<span style="font-size: x-small;"> (33.6% claimed) or the Flannan Isles EU-118 (32.3% claimed) but we don‚Äôt think this will happen, however keep checking back to this page to be sure you don‚Äôt miss us if we do decide to go.</span>

#### <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">**VHF**</span></span>

<span style="font-size: x-small;">We will be active on 6m, 4m (4m/6m X-band also) and 2m all week but mainly in the evenings due to other activities. We will be capable of 70cm activity but will only setup the 70cm stations if there is enough demand. Radios in use will be an IC-756pro3 for 6m with an </span>[<span style="font-size: x-small;">OZ2M</span>](http://www.rudius.net/oz2m/70mhz/transverter.htm)<span style="font-size: x-small;"> transverter for 4m and an IC-910H for 2m and 70cm. Antennas will be a 4 element dual-band 6m / 4m Jaybeam, a 17ele Tonna on 2m and a 22ele Tonna on 70cm, all will be mounted on our 10m </span>[<span style="font-size: x-small;">trailer mast</span>](http://www.camb-hams.com/gallery/v/various/Trailer+Mast/)<span style="font-size: x-small;"> but due to size restrictions only 2 antennas can be mounted at any time. SSB, JT6m and FSK441 will be the main modes used on all VHF/UHF bands and skeds are welcome to </span>[<span style="font-size: x-small;">skeds@camb-hams.com</span>](mailto:skeds@camb-hams.com)<span style="font-size: x-small;"> ‚Äì there is no CW op available for any of these bands. The cottage lies in IO67nt and has internet access so you will find us on </span>[<span style="font-size: x-small;">ON4KST chat</span>](http://www.on4kst.com/chat/start.php)<span style="font-size: x-small;"> (GS3PYE/P) or possibly MSN </span>[<span style="font-size: x-small;">IM@Camb-Hams.Com</span>](mailto:IM@Camb-Hams.Com)<span style="font-size: x-small;">.</span>
